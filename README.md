## Introduction

[Bourne Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell) was written by [Stephen Bourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_R._Bourne), which was the default shell for Version 7 Unix in 1979. We will only cover Bourne Shell `sh` `1977` and Bourne Again Shell `1989` There are other shells aswell, like:

- [Korn Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell) `ksh` `1983`
- [C Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_shell) `csh` `1978`
- [Z Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) `zsh` `1990`
- [Friendly Interactive Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_interactive_shell) `fish` `2005` 
- [Duplex Multi-Environment Real-Time Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-Environment_Real-Time) `DMERT`
- [Almquist Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell) `ash` `1989`
- [Run Commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rc) `rc` `1989`
- [PWB Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PWB_shell) `1975â€“77`

## Gates `Tutorial`


### Gate 1: Basics

`1.0.0.sh`
```Bash
#!/bin/sh

# Comments start with a hash code 

echo Welcome to GateOfShell # You can even have in-line comments 
```

- `#!/bin/sh` is to tell the location where the script needs to be executed, it is a standard location for a Bourne shell.

- `#` is to make a comment in script. Also note, #! is the only exception. 

- `echo` is a command, running here with three parameters: "Welcome", "to", "GateOfShell". Also note, since we are passing three parameters, it won't count space between them, to add spaces, you must use double quotes.

- To make a script executable, use `chmod 755 1.0.0.sh` or `chmod +x 1.0.0.sh`.

### Gate 2: Variables

`2.0.0.sh`
```Bash
#!/bin/sh

printMessage="Hello from Bourne";
echo printMessage
```

- Variable name, "=" and value should not have space between them. This is because after space, shell see everything as a parameter.

- You can't assign multiple values to a variable, so without quote, printMessage won't have have the same value, and it might throw errors.

`2.1.0.sh`
```Bash
#!/bin/sh


```
