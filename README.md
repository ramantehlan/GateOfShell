## Introduction

[Bourne Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell) was written by [Stephen Bourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_R._Bourne), which was the default shell for Version 7 Unix in 1979. We will only cover Bourne Shell `sh` `1977` and Bourne Again Shell `1989` There are other shells aswell, like:

- [Korn Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell) `ksh` `1983`
- [C Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_shell) `csh` `1978`
- [Z Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) `zsh` `1990`
- [Friendly Interactive Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_interactive_shell) `fish` `2005` 
- [Duplex Multi-Environment Real-Time Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-Environment_Real-Time) `DMERT`
- [Almquist Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell) `ash` `1989`
- [Run Commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rc) `rc` `1989`
- [PWB Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PWB_shell) `1975â€“77`

## Audience 

You are expected to have some prior experience, following are some prerequisites: 

- Programming Exposure.
- Familiarity with Unix/Linux shell.
- Basic Understanding of Unix Operating System.

## Environment 

To work with a shell script you need to have following prerequisites:

- Bourne Shell (/bin/sh)
- A Text Editor 

## Gates `Tutorial`


### Gate 1: Basics

`1.0.0.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/sh

# Comments start with a hash code 

echo Welcome to GateOfShell # You can even have in-line comments 
```

- `#!/bin/sh` is to tell the location where the script needs to be executed, it is a standard location for a Bourne shell.

- `#` is to make a comment in script. Also note, #! is the only exception. 

- `echo` is a command, running here with three parameters: "Welcome", "to", "GateOfShell". Also note, since we are passing three parameters, it won't count space between them, to add spaces, you must use double quotes.

- To make a script executable, use `chmod 755 1.0.0.sh` or `chmod +x 1.0.0.sh`.

- To execute a script write following command in terminal. 

```console
root@123.332.23.271 ~/GateOfShell $ ./1.0.0.sh
```

### Gate 2: Variables

`2.0.0.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/sh

printMessage="Hello from Bourne";
echo printMessage
```

- Variable name, = and value should not have space between them. This is because after space, shell see everything as a parameter.

- You can't assign multiple values to a variable, so without quote, printMessage won't have have the same value, and it might throw errors.

`2.1.0.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/sh

echo "Hello $name, welcome to the shell!"
echo "Let's start with your name?"
read name
echo "Nice to meet you $name!"
```

- `read` command is used to set a variable by users.

- Notice `$name` wasn't declared before using it in first echo, but used it won't throw a error, since you don't need to declare a variable before using it in Bourne Shell.

**Export** 

Variables can be used by other programs/scripts as well, but in order to do that, we must `export` them.

```console
root@123.332.23.271 ~/GateOfShell $ name="Prince"
root@123.332.23.271 ~/GateOfShell $ export name
root@123.332.23.271 ~/GateOfShell $ ./2.1.0.sh
```

Follow the commands above, and see the different in output this time. It will print `Hello Prince, welcome to the shell!` this time, earlier instead of 'Prince' it was blank.
